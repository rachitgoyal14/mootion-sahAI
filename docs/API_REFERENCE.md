# API Reference

This is a contract-style reference for the current Mootion backend endpoints.

## How To Read This File

For each endpoint, ask:

- what job does it do?
- when should the frontend call it?
- what data does it expect?
- what does it return?

The detailed behavior is documented in the domain docs:

- `AUTH_AND_RBAC.md`
- `ONBOARDING_AND_CLASSES.md`
- `CURRICULUM_MANUAL_FLOW.md`
- `CURRICULUM_PATCHING.md`
- `CHAPTERS.md`
- `ASSIGNMENTS.md`

## General Request Conventions

- Authenticated endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
- Teacher-only endpoints use `require_teacher`.
- Student-only endpoints use `require_student`.
- Curriculum patches require `expected_version`.

## Health

### `GET /`

Why it exists:

- lightweight server health check
- useful for deployment and local boot verification

## Practical Flow

1. Authenticate.
2. Teacher creates or joins a class.
3. Teacher creates or bootstraps curriculum.
4. Teacher bootstraps chapters from the curriculum.
5. Teacher creates a class-wide assignment for one chapter and one activity type.
6. The backend queues generation jobs.
7. The frontend polls assignment and chapter detail to show the result.
